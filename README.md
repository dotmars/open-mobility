# TransPod Open Mobility Initiative (TOMI)

Innovations in transportation are changing the way riders interact with transit systems. Emerging technologies such as self driving vehicles (to get you around within a city) and tube transport like the hyperloop and TransPod system (to link together metropolitan areas) will have an impact to reduce the burden of transportation access away from riders and to the service providers.

Discussion about the future of transportation often revolve around the technology itself - but the evolution will happen at all levels to affect the transportation ecosystem's infrastructure, value chain, energy consumption, finance, purchasing model, and end user-experience.

The increasing prevalence of ridesharing for vehicles and bikes is bringing about the shift from individual ownership of transportation (driving your own car) to being the user of a serviced mobility fleet (hailing a self driving vehicle for a ride). This shift acts as a catalyst for private organizations to offer traditionally public transportation solutions through infrastructure at a reasonable price and access to end consumers.

## Mobility as a Service

The concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) brings all methods of transport together in a single service, removing the hassle of planning and one-off payments. Taxis, public transport, car services and bike shares can interoperate seamlessly to manage daily travel in the most effective manner.

Use of a MaaS mobile application to handle bundling, routing, payments and customer experience will become the de-facto transport standard for commutes and leisure.  

## Our Vision and Mission

A successful transportation experience in a distributed transit ecosystem must be predicated on the development of an open technology platform that sets the standard for rider's data privacy.

The **TransPod Open Mobility Initiative (TOMI)** aims to set the precedent for upcoming Mobility as a Service ecosystems with a transparent software platform that can serve as the basis for interaction with transportation systems of all mediums.

At this moment history we have the opportunity to build out a *free (libre) and open source solution* to managing user interactions with transportation systems that will prioritize privacy, self-ownership of data and liberation from third parties to track your geolocation on every trip. To take ownership and get it right the first time in a manner to provide freedom to users is the driving force behind the development of this novel technology.

Proprietary software has dominated the enterprise and government space for decades. As software continues to "eat the world" and permeate into more facets of life we can make a difference to guide it in a manner to not give up the privacy and freedom of riders.
